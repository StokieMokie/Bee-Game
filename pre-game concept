- - - - Bee Game pre-concept ideas - - - - 


+ Game Design:



  - Summary  : Bee game is a 2d singleplayer/multiplayer racing game, (mainly created for mobile devices?), featuring time trial mode and highscore list.
               (In multiplayer mode players alternately struggle for the best score in time trial mode, on the same device.)



  - Gameplay : Collect as much pollen as you can and bring it to your base to earn points. Take care of npc enemies, which try
               to take you down. The game ends, if the player runs out of time.

               (Maybe the player only got "time" instead of health and everytime the player is hit by an enemy or a trap on the track,
               he might lose like 2-3sec of his time and he got different possibilities to stock it up again? [Like by collecting items
               which give you time, killing enemies or releasing pollen on the base?]


  - Mindset  : Give the player a feeling of action and speed, by navigating a bee through a dangerous track.



+ Graphics:

  - Style Attributes : 2d Cartoony "cardboard" style. (like little big planet for example.)
                       Graphics need a very plastic/three-dimensional style, with something like a brown cardboard-looking border
                       and need to be placed on different layers.


  - Atmosphere : funny? friendly? cool? ... or ... tough? badass? little evil?



+ Sounds/Music:

  - Style Attributes : Fast paced music, full of action, which gives the player a feeling of speed and power?
                       
                       (might be friendly and a bit funny as well??)



+ Level Design :

  - Themes : ?? Forrest ?? Outdoor-pool ?? 

  - Game Flow : -?? Player starts at base and can move in all different directions? Like the map is a big quader? Might be interesting, if the player
                 is good and collects much time, thus he has many possibilities to explore the track.
